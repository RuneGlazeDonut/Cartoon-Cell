# Cartoon Cellshade Texture Pack
Enhance your Ocarina of Time experience with awesome cartoon cellshaded Textures!
This Texture Pack is originally made by Djipi, but with no custom menu masks.
I am trying to revamp some of the item icons and some Textures, but full credit goes to Djipi for the **real** Texture pack; Which can be found <a href="https://www.n64textures.com/download/Djipi_Zelda_Cellshade_20_.zip">here</a>.

# Easy to Setup
Just like any other RICE Texture Pack - The instructions are super simple.

# Project64 3.0+ Setup

- Make sure your PJ64 has the **GLide64 video Plugin.**.
- Go to **Configuration** in PJ64 and **make sure the video Plugin is GLide64**.
- Now navigate over to **Graphics Settings**.
- Go to the **Texture Enhancement** Tab.
- Check these options: 
1. **Use Textures**.
2. Then **Use Full Transparencies**.
3. and finally **Compress Texture Cache**.

# With those Settings in place - The Textures will load
Now it's just a matter of placing the Textures into PJ64. To do this, go to:
- Your PJ64 download folder, open it.
- Open **Plugins** folder.
- Open **GFX** folder.
- Open **GLideN64** folder.
- Open **hires_textures** folder.
This is where the **extracted folder** with the Textures will go.

Now simply place the **extracted folder** with all the Textures in the **hires_textures** folder, name the Textures Folder **THE LEGEND OF ZELDA**, and load **Ocarina of Time with PJ64**.
You'll see the Textures compiling into the Cache, when that's done the game will load with the new Textures.

Since the Textures have compiled into the Cache - Venture over to the **cache folder** located above the **hires_textures** folder. If you see a **HTS File** (named **THE LEGEND OF ZELDA_HIRESTEXTURES.hts**) then it is safe to remove the Texture Folder from **hires_textures**.
